infoscreen_start_1;You are Anton Jakob Zellner, a Swiss policeman, that gets involved in an affair that\nessentially is to big for him. Three days ago a jewel, one of the two legendary\n"Eyes of the Sphinx" was stolen in London. The second Eye is on its way from Zurich to Cairo.
infoscreen_start_2;Aboard the train in the Swiss Alps a critical incident occured. The Raven, a master thief\nwanted by the police all around the globe, planted a bomb and it was Constable Zellner's\nvaliant intervention that prevented the worst. Now the Eye is on a ship on the Mediterranean.
infoscreen_start_3;Zellner, encouraged by his feat in the train, wants to supervise the jewels passage to Cairo.\nHowever, Nicholas Legrand, a French inspector leading the hunt for the Raven, doesn't\nwant Zellner to interfere. Zellner has a look around the ship and is knocked unconscious by\na shadowy figure...
